    <h1>Plan like a Park Ranger</h1>
    <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the power of glaciers, the
        persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
    <h2>Top Things to Know</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Pack your patience: millions of people visit Yosemite from April through October. Yosemite Valley is the
            main destination for most visitors but there are many places to go in the park</li>
        <li>Early birds avoid traffic! From spring through fall, arrive in the park before or after peak hours (before 9
            am and after 5 pm) to avoid delays and traffic congestion.</li>
        <li>Plan ahead: reservations are required to enter Yosemite from May 21 through September 30, 2021.</li>
        <li>Keep wildlife wild: do not approach or feed animals.</li>
        <li>Drive responsibly: observe posted speed limits and use pullouts to take pictures and let other cars pass.
        </li>
        <li>Protect Yosemite’s bears: always practice proper food storage and follow speed limits.</li>
        <li>
            Staying connected: cellular service is limited. Don’t be surprised if you can’t receive calls or texts in
            the park.</li>
