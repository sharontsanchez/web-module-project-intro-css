    <h1>Nature & Science</h1>
<p>Yosemiteâ€™s 747,956 acres (1,169 square miles), nearly 95 percent of which are designated Wilderness, are home to hundreds of wildlife species, and over a thousand plant species. Designated a World Heritage Site in 1984, Yosemite is known for its granite cliffs, waterfalls, clear streams, giant sequoia groves and biological diversity. Two Wild & Scenic Rivers, the Tuolumne and Merced rivers, begin in the park and flow west to the Central Valley. The park is a scientific laboratory of hydrology, geology and glaciology, amongst other sciences.</p>
